# [Newest release here](https://github.com/laneyfablab/LaneyShield/releases)

Health care workers need faceshields now. The Laney FabLab has created the LaneyVisor, a faceshield that can be rapidly produced using 3 components and with common industrial materials and injection molding techniques.

## Prerequisites for prototyping
Software
- [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview)
- [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) or other 2D vector editing software such as [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) or [Corel Draw](https://www.coreldraw.com/en/)

Hardware
- 3D printer
- Laser cutter
- CNC mill with drag knife for small scale manufacture
- Basic shop tools

## Development notes

This design is based off the face shield design from [Stratasys](https://www.stratasys.com/covid-19), a design firm in Wisconsin. Their design uses 3D printing as the primary manufacturing method. It is designed to be reusable and withstand sterilization. We have taken this design and modified it so that the top of the visor is closed, reducing dropplet contamination on the wearer. We have added additional clips so that users can use plastic that has been 3 hole punched, or use our plastic shield that wraps farther around the face.

## Prototyping process

We partnered with Delve and WEP Molding who have aided us in design changes and tooling consultation. We used our Ultimaker S5 to print iterations of our design in PLA. We wore the design for as long as we could, taking notes of design improvements. 

## Our current stage of development

Version 1.0 of the LaneyVisor is complete and WEP Molding has donated their efforts in fabricating the mold. Once fabricaiton is complete, we expect to produce up to 18,000 shields per week.
